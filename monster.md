### But what is that monster?

You're probably wondering what that monster is.

It's a sea monster, on the 1570 edition of Paolo Forlani's Map of the World.

It may seem scary at first glance, but you can see the innocense and kindness in its eyes (it can even cheer you up).

When you don't know what's out there (like map makers and mariner's of the 16th century), you
imagine monsters and terrifying places. But if you actually go out there,
you see that these unknown territorries that you thought would terrify you, are actually the best
parts of your world.
