### From Buildings to Software - Paving the Way to Construction

#### Description
As an architectural engineer by training, and working as a web dev for the past couple of years, Katerina will explain how architecture has defined the way she designs web apps and pages and how Angular has supported her in organising content. "A web page for me is like the facade of a house. From day one into web development, I looked at apps as if setting down plans for a new building. The process, like the process of building from the ground an establishment. I want to talk about scaffolding. I want to extend on designing the building blocks, the bricks made out of components. And as the construction is evolving, how materials fill in the empty spaces, making them consistent."

_Date:_ 1 Mar 2018

### Web Maps - Putting the M in Angular web apps!

#### Description
More and more web applications using Angular today need a kind of map, either to just display their location, or visualize their data. These data can be from points/locations of services/places/etc, or a user input, to more complex visuals like heatmaps or paths. These visualizations can easily be achieved with OpenLayers open source library, or even the Google Maps JS API. However, the integration with Angular and the use of its tools is not always straightforward. In this presentation I will show examples of how to integrate OpenLayers and Google Maps easily into your Angular application without the use of any external libraries. Part of the presentation will also show some techniques for visualising spatial data on these maps.

## WeAreDevelopers 2018
_Location:_ Vienna, Austria

_Date:_ 18 May 2018

### Websockets turning physical motion into virtual motion!

#### Description
In my presentation, I will show how you can use physical motion (moving your phone around) to move graphics on the browser (virtual motion). We will see how to develop a simple application using WebSockets, Angular and a plain WebSocket client/server node.js server. Once connected from our phone, we will be sending device data from our phone to the browser (using the brand new device event APIs capturing device acceleration, orientation, motion). Tools that are going to be used will be the WebSockets API, Angular, RxJS and a little Node.js server. RxJS and its observable sequences will help us subscribe and listen to our incoming messages, firing events in the process. In the end, there will be an interactive session (users connected to the same network will be able to move graphics with their phone).

## Voxxed Days Athens 2018
_Location:_ Athens, Greece

_Date:_ 1 Jun 2018

### Angular real time interactions with WebSockets

#### Description
Using Angular and WebSockets we will be turning physical motion into virtual motion, in order to perform actions in our browser (navigation, event firing, etc). We will see the integration process step-by-step, resulting in a simple web application using WebSockets, Angular and a plain WebSocket client/server node.js server. Once we launch this application on our phone, it will start sending device motion data from our phone to the browser, using the brand new device event APIs to capture our device’s acceleration, orientation and motion, and our node.js server to perform the transmission. The browser will receive the motion data, and it will translate it into events and actions on the big screen! Tools that are going to be used are the WebSockets API, Angular, RxJS and a little Node.js server. Observable sequences will help us subscribe and listen to incoming messages, firing events in the process. The presentation will be interactive (users connected to the same network will be able to send data with their phone, too).

## Angular UP 2018
_Location:_ Tel Aviv, Israel

_Date:_ 21 Jun 2018

### Angular - Maps - Users of Apps

#### Description
Maps, today, are an essential of the internet. Think of any app, and you will realize that it uses a map either to just display a location, or visualize data. Most of these apps, however, also use that map as a user interface, where the user can enter their location and receive corresponding, location based services or suggestions. Take for example car services apps (Uber, Beat), dating apps (Tinder), search-and-discovery apps (Foursquare), or any social app (Facebook, Twitter). In this presentation we will see how to create an Angular app that uses the Google Maps JS API and Firebase to match users together according to their chosen location! We will learn about Angular integration with Google Maps, user input on Google Maps and Angular and data display on Google Maps (the user generated data). The presentation will be interactive and engaging, since participants will be prompted to input their location and see the results live on the big screen. We will see code and examples and discuss implementation techniques.

### Workshop: Getting Real-Time with Firebase and Angular

#### Workshop Description
The participants of this workshop will work hands on with Firebase in an Angular application. They will walk along a journey of developing an app with Angular and the real-time magic of Firebase, using the angularfire2 library. Firebase acts as a backend as a service and takes care of real time synchronization across apps and platforms. The participants will learn about and use the main Firebase modules needed to develop a simple social application. They will use Authentication, cloud storage and the Real-Time database. Best practices about application planning will be discussed, like structuring the data in the API and decisions that need to be made in advance. At the end of this workshop, each participant will have created and deployed a simple web application. The workshop needs prior knowledge of web development. Some basic Angular experience is preferable, but not essential. No prior knowledge of Firebase is needed. The users will need a web-development-friendly laptop (preferably a Unix-based system, or Windows with nodejs and npm installed).

#### Workshop info
_Date:_ 6 Sep 2018

_Duration:_ 4 hours

_Location:_ Thessaloniki, Greece

_Date:_ 19 Nov 2018

### Exploring the Lighthouse

#### Description
In this session will explore the awesome Lighthouse tool and its cool features. We will start from bootstrapping a simple web application, and we will see how we can reach better scores in each of the five audits of Lighthouse, “PWA”, “Performance”, “Accessibility”, “Best Practices” and “SEO” in our web applications. The purpose of the talk will be to showcase how the Lighthouse tool can help us build better apps for the web, and the mobile web. And the accessible web. And the web where connectivity is poor and you end up playing T-Rex runner.
