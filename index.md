This is just a place listing my info and what i'm up to.

I like web, i like code, i like [angular](https://angular.io/) and i like talking about all this. Go to [talks](/talks) to see
what i'm up to.

I also organize (together with a bunch of cool people) [AngularAthens](https://meetup.com/Angular-Athens/), the Angular meetup in Athens, Greece.

Make sure to check out my [github](https://github.com/mandarini), my [twitter](https://twitter.com/psybercity) and my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katerinaskroumpelou/) for more.

I generally go by three aliases on the internetz: mandarini, psybercity, pakotinia.
