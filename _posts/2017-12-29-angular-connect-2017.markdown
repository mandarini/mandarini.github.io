## the conference

Well, this year I had the incredible opportunity to present at Angular Connect 2017. 
I was planning this since April 2017, asking for help in what to submit
in the hangouts office hours and frantically searching for a way to fit my
not so technical experience into a worthy talk.

Finally, with the help and suggestions of the AngularConnect team, I decided
to make a talk about my journey from Architectural Engineering studies into
professional web development. The essence would be how I got to transfer skills I
learned/acquired in architectural engineering school into my professional life as a web developer.

My talk was accepted initially as a lightning talk, which was just as wonderful for me!
I set down and prepared my 5 minutes slides and talk, being all to careful to stay within the time limit.

Then the incredible happened. I was flying to London on Friday the 3rd. My presentation was set for Tuesday the 7th of
 November. On Thursday the 2nd I received an email from the organizers inviting me to give a 20 minute talk instead!
 Words are not enough to express my excitement. I accepted the offer and I got down to work. Luckily, Peter from the
 organizers was there to help me get all prepared, with rehearsals and advice.
 
 Finally, all was ready!
 
 The big day came and I was there in the morning, second talk after the keynote, after a great technical talk from
 Olivier Combe about i18n, which made me even more nervous! :) However, I went on stage and I delivered my talk.
 I hold on to that feeling and I have to say it was unique.

 After the hard part was over, I was able to enjoy the rest of the conference without worrying, having fun and 
 learing all new things about Angular. And, of course, meeting a whole bunch of new people, feeling at home,
 feeling that I was among friends.

## ngGirls
 
The first day of the conference was dedicated to a number of angular workshops. One of these was organized by ngGirls,
and I had the chance to be a mentor for women wanting an intro to angular.

I enjoyed the experience and I had great fun working with a first year of college student, building together a simple
 angular application. I strongly believe that these kind of workshops are very important, because, from my personal 
 experience, women are not yet a norm in the technology sector, something that might discourage many of us to 
 be involved or choose such a career. One of the consequences is that usually women in the tech sector feel the need
 to prove themselves more than men do. Getting them onto a path (however early or late) towards a tech career and
 introducing them into an environment filled with women who follow it already, might make them feel stronger
 and see that they can, too, belong there, without needing to prove anything else. More on this on a future post,
 maybe. :)
